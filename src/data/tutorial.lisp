;;; BKNR Datastore

;;;# Introduction
;;;
;;;## The prevalence model
;;;
;;; The BKNR datastore is a persistence solution for Lisp data. It
;;; uses the prevalence model, which is based on the following
;;; assumptions:
;;;
;;; All data is held in RAM.
;;;
;;; Data can be saved to disk at once into a snapshot file and is read
;;; from that file at startup time.
;;;
;;; Changes to persistent data are written to a transaction log file
;;; immediately, which can be replayed to restore all changes that
;;; occured since the last snapshot was saved.
;;;
;;; Every kind of operation that needs to be logged is called a
;;; "transaction", and such transactions are made explicit in the
;;; program code. This is different from object-oriented databases,
;;; where the fundamental transactions are object creation, object
;;; deletion and slot access, which are not special cases in the
;;; prevalence model at all.
;;;
;;; Isolation of transactions is achieved using thread locks. In the
;;; simplest model used by the `mp-store', transactions are serialized
;;; using a global lock.
;;;
;;; The transaction system is responsible for providing replay of
;;; committed transactions after a server crash, but not for rollback
;;; of failed transactions in a running server, except that failing
;;; transactions are simply not logged onto disk. To roll back
;;; transactions at points where exceptions might be excepted, use
;;; ordinary Lisp programming techniques involving `unwind-protect'
;;; and similar.
;;;
;;;## BKNR Datastore Design
;;;
;;; The design of the datastore aims to make explicit the
;;; orthogonality of object system access (unlogged) and logging of
;;; transactions (essentially independent of the object system). The
;;; interface between transaction system and object system is
;;; documented and allows for the implementation of alternative object
;;; systems. For example, the blob subsystem is using the same
;;; interface as the object subsystem.
;;;
;;; Previous versions of the BKNR Datastore allowed the creation of
;;; multiple datastores in a single LISP process. However, this
;;; feature was seldom used, and could be very confusing while
;;; developing applications. The new version of the BKNR Datastore
;;; supports only a single datastore, which is referenced by the
;;; special variable `*STORE*'.
;;;
;;;## BKNR Object Datastore
;;;
;;; In addition to the transaction layer (in the file `txn.lisp'), the
;;; BKNR datastore provides persistent CLOS objects using the
;;; Metaobject Protocol. It provides a metaclass with which slots can
;;; be defined as persistent (stored on snapshot) or transient. The
;;; metaclass also prohibits slot accesses outside transactions,
;;; provides unique IDs for all objects, and provides standard query
;;; functions like `STORE-OBJECTS-WITH-CLASS' and
;;; `STORE-OBJECTS-OF-CLASS'. The object datastore can be seamlessly
;;; combined with BKNR indices and XML import/export.

;;;# Obtaining and loading BKNR Datastore
;;;
;;; You can obtain the current CVS sources of BKNR by following the
;;; instructions at `http://bknr.net/blog/bknr-devel'. Add the `experimental'
;;; directory of BKNR to your `asdf:*central-registry*', and load the
;;; indices module by evaluating the following form:

(asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op :bknr.datastore)

;;; Then switch to the `bknr.datastore' package to try out the tutorial.

(in-package :bknr.datastore)

;;;# A transaction system example

;;; The first datastore we will build is very simple. We have a
;;; counter variable for the store, and this counter variable can be
;;; decremented and indecremented. We want this variable to be
;;; persistent, so decrementing and incrementing it has to be done
;;; through transactions that will be logged by the datastore. We also
;;; define a `:BEFORE' method for the generic function `RESTORE-STORE'
;;; to set the counter to `0' initially. This method will be called
;;; every time the store is created or restored from disk.

(defclass tutorial-store (mp-store)
  ((counter :initform 0 :accessor tutorial-store-counter)))

(defmethod restore-store :before ((store tutorial-store) &key until)
  (declare (ignore until))
  (setf (tutorial-store-counter store) 0))

;;; The two transactions are declared like normal functions, but using
;;; the `DEFTRANSACTION' macro. 

(deftransaction incf-counter ()
  (incf (tutorial-store-counter *store*)))

(deftransaction decf-counter ()
  (decf (tutorial-store-counter *store*)))

;;; When looking at the macro-expanded form of `DEFTRANSACTION', we
;;; see that `DEFTRANSACTION' defines two functions, a toplevel
;;; function that creates a transaction object and calls the method
;;; `EXECUTE' on it, and a function that contains the actual
;;; transaction code and that will be called in the context of the
;;; transaction, and logged to disk.

(PROGN (DEFUN TX-DECF-COUNTER ()
         (UNLESS (IN-TRANSACTION-P) (ERROR 'NOT-IN-TRANSACTION))
         (DECF (TUTORIAL-STORE-COUNTER *STORE*)))
       (DEFUN DECF-COUNTER ()

;;; The new datastore only supports a single datastore instance per
;;; LISP instance. When creating a `STORE' object, the `*STORE*'
;;; special variable is modified to point to the datastore. Thus, we
;;; can create our simple datastore by creating an object of type
;;; `TUTORIAL-STORE'. The transaction log will be store in the
;;; directory "/tmp/tutorial-store".

;;; persistent state.

;;; To do this, we have to create a store-subsystem that will be able
;;; to write the counter number to a file and to reload it on restore.

;;; The first method is `INITIALIZE-SUBSYSTEM', which is called after

;;; certain parameters of the subsystem. We won't use this method
;;; here, as our subsystem is very simple.
;;; The second method is `SNAPSHOT-SUBSYSTEM', which is called when
;;; the store is snapshotted. The subsystem has to store the
;;; persistent data it handles to a snapshot file inside the current
;;; directory of the store. Our `COUNTER-SUBSYSTEM' writes the current
;;; value of the counter to a file named "counter" in the current
;;; directory of the store (the old directory has been renamed).

;;; Finally, the method `RESTORE-SUBSYSTEM' is called at restore time
;;; to tell the subsystem to read back its persistent state from the
;;; current directory of the store. Our `COUNTER-SUBSYSTEM' reads back
;;; the counter value from the file named "counter". If it can't find
;;; the file (for example if this is the first time that our datastore
;;; is created, the file won't be there, so we issue a warning and set
;;; the counter value to 0.

;;;# An object store example

;;; The BKNR object datastore is implemented using a special subsystem
;;; `STORE-OBJECT-SUBSYSTEM'. Every object referenced by the store
;;; object subsystem has a unique ID, and must be of the class
;;; `STORE-OBJECT'. The ID counter in the store-object subsystem is
;;; incremented on every object creation.
;;;
;;; All store objects have to be of the metaclass `PERSISTENT-CLASS',
;;; which will ensure the object is referenced in the base indices of
;;; the object datastore, and that slot access is only done inside a
;;; transaction. The subsystem makes heavy use of BKNR indices, and
;;; indexes object by ID and by class.

;;; The ID index can be queried using the functions
;;; `STORE-OBJECT-WITH-ID', which returns the object with the
;;; requested ID, `ALL-STORE-OBJECTS' which returns all current store
;;; objects, and `MAP-STORE-OBJECTS', which applies a function
;;; iteratively to each store object. The class index can be queried
;;; using the functions `ALL-STORE-CLASSES', which returns the names
;;; of all the classes currently present in the datastore, and
;;; `STORE-OBJECTS-WITH-CLASS', which returns all the objects of a
;;; specific class (across superclasses also, so
;;; `(STORE-OBJECTS-WITH-CLASS \'STORE-OBJECT)' returns all the
;;; existing store objects.

;;; it using the usual CLOS protocol.  In order to perform any

;;; instance, the `INITIALIZE-INSTANCE' function must be specialized
;;; for the persistent class.  In addition, the datastore calls the
;;; `INITIALIZE-TRANSIENT-INSTANCE' for the new object when it is
;;; initially created as well as when it is restored from the
;;; transaction log or snapshot file.  It may be used to initialize
;;; transient aspects of the objects, but it must not alter the
;;; persistent state of the object.  `INITIALIZE-TRANSIENT-INSTANCE'
;;; does not have access to the initargs used to initially create the
;;; persistent instance.

;;;## Adding indices to store objects

;;; The object datastore builds upon the functionality of the BKNR

;;; `INDEXED-CLASS', so adding indices is seamless. Indices are

;;; restored. Adding an index on a transient slot or on a persistent
;;; slot makes no difference.

;;;## Adding blobs

;;; A blob is a Binary Large OBject, that means it is a normal
;;; persistent object with an associated binary data (that most of the
;;; time is quite large). The object datastore supports storing this
;;; large binary data outside the transaction log and the snapshot
;;; file in order not to strain the store memory footprint too much,
;;; and to be able to access the binary data from outside the LISP
;;; session. This can be useful in order to copy the binary data using
;;; the operating system calls directly. Blobs are used to store
;;; images in the BKNR Web Framework (in fact, eboy.com contains more
;;; than 40000 images). They have also been used to store MP3 files
;;; for the GPN interactive DJ.
;;;
;;; In addition to the binary data, a blob object also holds a `TYPE'
;;; and a `TIMESTAMP'. The type of a blob object is a keyword somehow
;;; identifying the type of binary data it stores. For example, for
;;; the images of the eboy datastore, we used the keywords `:JPEG',
;;; `:PNG', `:GIF' to identity the different file formats used to
;;; store images. The timestamp identifies the time of creation of the
;;; blob object (this can be useful to cache binary data of blob
;;; objects in a web server context).
;;;
;;; Stores are implemented in a custom subsystem, which takes as key
;;; argument `:DIRECTORY' the name of a directory where the binary
;;; data of the blob objects is stored as a simple file. This
;;; directory can be further partitioned dynamically by the datastore,
;;; when provided with the argument `:N-BLOBS-PER-DIRECTORY'. The
;;; value of this argument is stored in the directory of the
;;; datastore, so that a future instance of the blob subsystem is
;;; initialised correctly.
;;;
;;; We can now add blob support to our existing object datastore by
;;; adding the blob subsystem to its list of subsystems.

;;; `MAKE-INSTANCE' and the function `BLOB-FROM-FILE'. The method
;;; `BLOB-FROM-FILE' fills the binary data of a blob object by reading
;;; the content of a file. This binary data is then stored in a file
;;; named after the ID of the object in the blob root directory of the
;;; blob subsystem.

(named-blob-from-file (make-pathname :directory '(:absolute "tmp")
				     :name "bla" :type "jpg")
		      :name "foobar" :type :jpg)

; => #<NAMED-BLOB ID: 11, NAME: foobar, TYPE: jpg>

;;; We can work with the named-blob object in the same way as with a
;;; normal object. However, we can access the binary data using the
;;; methods `BLOB-PATHNAME', which returns the pathname to the file in
;;; the blob root that holds the binary data of the object.

(blob-pathname (store-object-with-id 11))
; => #P"/tmp/object-store/blob-root/11"

;;; The method `BLOB-TO-FILE' and `BLOB-TO-STREAM' write the binary
;;; data of the object to the specified file or stream (the stream has
;;; to be of the type `(UNSIGNED-BYTE 8)'). The macro `WITH-OPEN-BLOB'
;;; is provided as wrapper around the `WITH-OPEN-FILE' macro.

;;;## Relaxed references

;;; It sometimes happens that a persistent object is deleted while it
;;; still is referenced by another object. This can lead to problems
;;; when snapshotting and restoring the datastore, as the referenced
;;; object is not available anymore.
;;;
;;; When a slot is specified as being a relaxed object reference slot
;;; using the slot option `:RELAXED-OBJECT-REFERENCE', a reference to
;;; an unexistent object can be encoded during snapshot. The object
;;; subsystem issues a warning when a reference to a non-existent
;;; object is encoded. When a reference to a deleted object is decoded
;;; form the snapshot file, a `NIL' value is returned if the slot from
;;; where the object is referenced supports relaxed references. Else,
;;; an error is thrown.

;;;# Store internals

;;;## Binary data files
;;;
;;; This implementation of the BKNR datastore uses a binary encoding
;;; of Lisp data. The encoding library is used by both the transaction
;;; system and the object system and is mostly independent of
;;; them. Users need not be aware of the details of this encoding,
;;; except that (1) primitive data stored needs to be supported by the
;;; encoding library and (2) user-defined object systems need to
;;; register their own encoder and decoder methods to allow their
;;; objects to be used as part of transaction arguments.

Function ENCODE (OBJECT STREAM)

Function DECODE (STREAM) =<  OBJECT

;;; The `STREAM' must be specialized on `(unsigned-byte 8)'.

;;; The object store subsystem uses the encoding library to encode the
;;; persistent state of all the objects in the store. It does this by
;;; first serializing the layout of a class (which is a list of
;;; slot-names), then by first serializing the class and the id of
;;; each object, and finally by serializing the slots of each
;;; object. This two-step system is necessary to correctly serialize
;;; circular of forward references.

;;; When the snapshot is loaded, an empty instance of each object is
;;; created, and can be referenced only using the `ID'. After each
;;; object has been instantiated, it can be referenced by another
;;; object. The objects are serialized in the order they have been
;;; created.

;;;## Datastore state

;;; The store always is in one of the following states:

;;; :closed - No store is open, no persistent operations are
;;; possible.  It is an error, which will eventually be signaled, to
;;; execute transactions in this state.

;;; :restore - The store is currently recovering from a restart

;;; :idle - The store has been opened and is prepared to execute
;;; transactions.

;;; :transaction - The store is currently executing a transaction

;;; Note that all transactions are serialized and thus only one
;;; transaction can be active at any time.

;;; :snapshot - The store is currently writing a snapshot.

;;;## Transactions

;;; Transactions are objects of the class `TRANSACTION', and have a
;;; slot containing the symbol of their transaction function, as well
;;; as a list of the arguments that have to be passed to this
;;; function. When a transaction is executed, a timestamp
;;; of the execution time is stored in the object.

;;; Transactions can be grouped by enclosing them with a
;;; with-transaction block.  All subtransactions will be logged to the
;;; transaction log as a group and only re-executed on restore time
;;; when the complete group could be read from the file.

(defun foo-bar ()
  (with-transaction ()
    (invoke-transaction-a)
    (invoke-transaction-b)))

;;; The persistent object store further supports the use of anonymous
;;; transactions by automatically converting instance creation and
;;; slot writes to transaction invocations which are atomically
;;; executed upon restore time.

;;;## Snapshot and restore procedures

;;; When the datastore is snapshotted, the transaction layer ensures
;;; that the store is opened, and that there are subsystems in the
;;; store. Without subsystems, the transaction log is the only way for
;;; the store to achieve persistence, and no snapshot can be made. The
;;; store is then switched to read-only, and a backup directory is
;;; created, containing the current transaction log and previous
;;; snapshot files. This way, the older state of the datastore is not
;;; lost. Then, each subsystem is asked to save its persistent state
;;; by calling the method `SNAPSHOT-SUBSYSTEM'. When an error is
;;; thrown during the snapshot of the subsystems, the backup directory
;;; is renamed to be the current directory, and the store is
;;; reopened.

;;; When the datastore is restored, the store is switched to read
;;; only, and each subsystem is asked to restore its persistent
;;; state. Note that the subsystems are restored in the order in which
;;; they are listed in the `SUBSYSTEMS' slot of the store, so that
;;; dependent subsystems are restored last. When an error is thrown
;;; while restoring the subsystems, the store is closed, and already
;;; opened subsystems are closed using the method
;;; `CLOSE-SUBSYSTEM'. After the restoring of all the subsystems, the
;;; transaction log file is read, and each transaction recorded is
;;; executed. This is where the `UNTIL' parameter comes into
;;; play. Transactions that have been executed after the time of
;;; `UNTIL' are discarded.

;;;## Filesystem syncing

;;; By default, the transaction log file is synced after a transaction
;;; has been executed, so that all the data is correctly written on
;;; disk. However, this can be a major performance stopper when
;;; executing a big batch of transactions (for example, deleting a few
;;; thousands objects). You can disable the mandatory syncing by
;;; executing your transactions inside the form `WITHOUT-SYNC'.

(without-sync ()
  (execute-a-lot-of-transactions))

;;;## Snapshotting and restoring the object subsystem

;;; Snapshotting and restoring the object subsystem is a bit tricky,
;;; as additional systems come into play. When the object subsystem is
;;; snapshotted using the method `SNAPSHOT-SUBSYSTEM', a snapshot file
;;; containing a binary dump of all the current store objects is
;;; created. First, the layouts of the objects (the name of their
;;; slots) is stored, and minimal information about each object is
;;; stored in the order of their creation (the minimal information
;;; consists of the class of the object, and its ID). After this
;;; information has been stored for each object, the slot values of
;;; the store objects (again in the order of their creation) are
;;; stored in the snapshot file. These two phases are necessary to
;;; allow the snapshotting of circular or forward-referencing
;;; structures.

;;; When the object subsystem is restored, all the indices for classes
;;; contained in the store are cleared in order to accomodate for the
;;; new objects. Be very careful when using class indices that are not
;;; related to store objects. The ID counter of the store subsystem is
;;; reset to 0, and the class-layouts are read from the snapshot
;;; file. Then, the minimal information for each object is read, and
;;; an "empty version" of each object is instantiated. Thus, the
;;; objects can be referenced by their ID. Then, the slot values for
;;; each object are read from the snapshot file, references are
;;; resolved (check the section about relaxed references). Finally,
;;; after each slot value has been set, the method
;;; `INITIALIZE-TRANSIENT-INSTANCE' is called for each created
;;; object.

;;;## Garbage collecting blobs

;;; The binary data of deleted blob objects is kept in the blob root
;;; directory by default. If you want to purge the binary data of
;;; deleted objects, you can use the function
;;; `DELETE-ORPHANED-BLOB-FILES'. However, take note that you won't be
;;; able to restore the persistent state anteriour to the deletion of
;;; the blobs, as their binary data is not stored in the transaction
;;; log and not backed up by the snapshot method of the blob
;;; subsystem.

;;;## Schema evolution in the datastore

;;; The transaction log only stores when a transaction is called, and
;;; with which arguments. However, it doesn't store the definition of
;;; the transaction itself. When the transaction definition is
;;; changed, the transaction log may be restored in a different way,
;;; according to the changes made in the code.
;;;
;;; In the same way, class definition changes are not recorded in the
;;; transaction log. When a class definition is changed (for example a
;;; slot initform is changed), the existing instances of the class are
;;; updated accordingly. However, when the snapshot is restored in a
;;; future session, the objects may be different than those created at
;;; the last restore.
;;;
;;; The only way to cleanly upgrade transaction definitions and class
;;; definitions is to make a snapshot after the changes have been
;;; made. In a future version of the datastore, we hope to store all
;;; the application sourcecode, so that a restore to a certain point
;;; in time does not depend on the latest version of the code. The
;;; object subsystem warns when a class definition is changed, and
;;; urges the developer to make a snapshot of the database. Please be
;;; careful, this can be a pretty tricky source of bugs.
